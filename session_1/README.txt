This week we will go over the different ways to loop.
my personal favorites are "for loops" and "map loops", why? no reason I just prefered them
that means other devs have other favorites therefore is best to gain knowlege in all the ways to do it
when you google question youll find the internet riddled with the different ways to loop 
so dont limit yourself to only learning your favorites, because that will limit which forums you can visit
or which videos to watch

whats my obsession with loops? well think of it like this.
you have e-commerce site you want build.
now lets say you 100 products and you want to display the picture of each item
you can copy and paste the <img> tag in html 100 times or you can create a loop that does it for you
later down the road we will do that and simplify your code 


now dont get it twisted, loops are a hard concept to grasp at first but when you understand it
it becomes sencond nature, we will go over them again next week


here are your objectives:
  create a glabal array 
  each loop must create a new array and push the values of the global array in to it
  the function will then return the new array
